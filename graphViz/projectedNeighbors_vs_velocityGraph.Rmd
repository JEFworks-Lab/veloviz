scVelo builds a "velocity graph" based on a similarity matrix. Entries in the similarity matrix are the cosine similarity between the velocity vector and the cell difference vector. Additionally, scVelo computes a transition matrix, in which entries represent the probabilities of cell-->cell transitions. These probabilities are calculated based on the similarities from above. Here, we want to build a graph using these two matrices as adjacency matrices and compare the resulting force-directed embeddings to the embedding that we build using the composite distance function. 

#### Setup and get data from scVelo
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#using velocyto2 evironment 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(reticulate)
library(igraph)
library(matie)
library(RANN)
library(velocyto.R)
library(MUDAN)
library(RSpectra)
library(umap)
source("projectedNeighbors.R")
```
